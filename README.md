Essential the whole system can be summed up as an <b>Osteoarthritis Grade Prediction and Concise Report Generation System</b>. Primarily the main motivation behind the project was that the traditional method takes too much time mainly due to high population, dependence on experience of Radiologist, art effects on X-ray images, management of physical reports and Lack of proper infrastructure and services in rural regions.
<br><br>
A full-fledged system with <b>1/5th the size of industry standard model</b> (published by Stanford in early 2019) <b>and an increment in accuracy from 69.7% to 75.42% </b>([more details here](./SystemDetails/ModelDetails.png)) and a proprietary Pre-processing method which is able to resolve all sorts of art effects from images ([sample results]). Alongside that, a robust web application with a proper database management system.System is designed in a way to be more scalable in future.
